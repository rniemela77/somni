# How to avoid bias in app

## Contextual cueing by design/branding
Explanation: Quiz visuals or branding shape expectations and answers.
Example: Corporate logo suggesting professional persona.
Better: Use neutral, minimalist design without branding cues.


## Priming by preceding content
Explanation: Earlier images or text influence interpretation of later items.
Example: Mood‑inducing pictures before personality items.
Better: Avoid irrelevant priming or include neutral buffers between sections.


## Mood state effects
Explanation: Temporary emotions skew trait assessments.
Example: Answering pessimistically during a bad day.
Better: Screen for current mood and control or schedule quiz when mood is neutral.


## Environmental distractions
Explanation: Noisy or busy surroundings reduce focus and increase errors.
Example: Completing quiz in a crowded café.
Better: Prompt user to find a quiet environment before starting.


## Device/interface usability
Explanation: Poor layout or mobile glitches cause misclicks.
Example: Overlapping buttons on smartphone view.
Better: Test interface across devices; ensure responsive design and clear touch targets.
