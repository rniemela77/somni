This list identifies common flaws in quiz questions and provides for each an explanation, an example of a poor item, and an improved version:

Clarifying quiz question issues

## Ambiguous wording
Explanation: Terms lacking precision leave respondents guessing what counts as a valid answer.
Example: “Do you often feel stress?” (What qualifies as “often” or “stress”?)
Better: “In the past two weeks, on how many days did you feel overwhelmed by work demands?”

## Double‑barreled queries
Explanation: Combining two questions in one forces compromise answers that satisfy neither.
Example: “Do you enjoy teamwork and independent projects?”
Better: Separate: “Do you enjoy collaborating in a team?” and “Do you enjoy working on tasks alone?”

## Leading or loaded phrasing
Explanation: Language that implies a ‘‘correct’’ answer inflates responses in that direction.
Example: “Most successful people read daily; how often do you read?”
Better: Neutral: “How many days per week do you read books or articles?”

## Vague response options
Explanation: Labels without context let respondents interpret scales inconsistently.
Example: “Rate your satisfaction: 1–5.”
Better: “Rate your satisfaction with your job work‑life balance: 1 = Very dissatisfied, 5 = Very satisfied.”

## Insufficient answer choices
Explanation: Omitting response ranges forces misfits into adjacent categories.
Example: “What is your age? Under 30, 30–50.”
Better: Provide full spectrum: “Under 25, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65+.”

## Social desirability bias
Explanation: Desire to appear virtuous skews answers toward socially approved behaviors.
Example: “How often do you recycle?” (Likely over‑reporting.)
Better: Anchor to specific timeframe: “In the past month, on how many days did you recycle household waste?”

## Impression management
Explanation: Conscious tailoring of answers to craft a favorable self‑image.
Example: “Rate your leadership skills on a scale of 1–10.”
Better: Use scenario assessment: “In a team crisis, how likely would you volunteer to coordinate tasks? 1 = Very unlikely, 5 = Very likely.”

## Self‑deception
Explanation: Honest but inaccurate self‑views distort response accuracy.
Example: “How organized are you?” (Overestimation.)
Better: Behavioral frequency: “How many days last week did you clean and organize your workspace?”

## Framing effects
Explanation: Positive versus negative wording shifts perceived meaning and responses.
Example: “How often do you avoid mistakes?”
Better: Direct: “How often do you make mistakes?”

## Acquiescence bias
Explanation: Habitual agreement regardless of item content inflates positive endorsements.
Example: Agree/disagree item: “I am good at multitasking.”
Better: Include reverse‑worded items: “I struggle to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.”

## Recall distortion
Explanation: Faulty memory recall misestimates past behaviors or feelings.
Example: “How many times did you go to the gym last month?”
Better: Shorten recall interval: “How many times did you go to the gym last week?”

## Memory decay
Explanation: Passage of time erodes accuracy of stated past feelings or actions.
Example: “Describe your mood three months ago.”
Better: Focus on recent period: “Describe your mood over the past two days.”

## Cultural or linguistic misinterpretation
Explanation: Idioms or colloquialisms may not translate across backgrounds.
Example: “Are you the early bird or night owl?”
Better: Literal: “Do you prefer waking early or staying up late?”

## Self‑serving bias
Explanation: Attributing successes to personal traits and failures to external factors inflates positive self‑views.Example: “I succeeded because I’m talented.”
Better: Frame questions to capture objective behaviors: “How many times did you meet deadlines on your own versus with help?”

## Self‑concept clarity
Explanation: Uncertainty about personal traits yields inconsistent answers.
Example: Fluctuating agreement to “I am adventurous.”
Better: Anchor items to specific situations: “On your last vacation, how many high‑adrenaline activities did you try?”

## Identity‑protective cognition
Explanation: Dismissing information that threatens self‑identity leads to biased answers.
Example: Rejecting feedback that suggests low empathy.
Better: Use indirect measures: “How often do friends describe you as empathetic?”

## Cognitive dissonance
Explanation: Discomfort from conflicting beliefs and actions prompts answer adjustments.
Example: Underreporting unhealthy eating to align with healthy‑eater self‑image.
Better: Ask factual frequency: “How many times did you eat fried food in the last week?”

## Confirmation bias
Explanation: Searching memory for evidence that supports existing self‑beliefs ignores counterexamples.
Example: Overestimating creativity by recalling only successful creative projects.
Better: Prompt balanced recall: “List both creative successes and failures from the past month.”

## Stereotype threat
Explanation: Anxiety about confirming negative stereotypes leads to underreporting traits.
Example: Women underreporting math confidence.
Better: Use gender‑neutral framing and reassure no judgment on performance.

## Role internalization
Explanation: Adopting perceived test roles influences answers to fit that role.
Example: Answering leadership items as a manager rather than personal style.
Better: Clarify perspective: “Answer based on your personal behavior, not your job title.”

## Scenario overload
Explanation: Complex hypotheticals increase working memory demands (e.g., processing five variables simultaneously), leading to random or heuristic responses.
Example: “Imagine you’re stranded on an island with five variables (food availability, weather, shelter options, companions, time frame); what is your first action?”
Better: Limit to one element per scenario to reduce cognitive load: “Imagine you only need to choose between three shelter types; which would you pick?”
