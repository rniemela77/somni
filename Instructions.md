# Project Specification: Inner‑World Mapping and Level‑Based Guidance

## 1. Objectives

- Surface user’s underlying emotional state by life domain (work, home, relationships, self).

- Map core emotion to David Hawkins’ levels of consciousness.

- Provide actionable advice aimed at next-higher level.

- Embed micro‑hypnosis or narrative exercises to shift user state.

## 2. Question Design

- Replace rigid MCQs with vivid vignettes: present two short scenarios, ask which "feels more like you now."

- Use slider scales on ambiguous prompts: "I see my future as…(vague↔️clear)."

- Life‑domain prompts: "In my career I feel…(trapped↔️empowered)." Avoid labels; rely on emotional resonance.

## 3. Classification Framework

- Map each response vector to Hawkins’ levels (20–1000 scale).

- Calibrate thresholds: shame<150, guilt<200, fear<250, desire<310, anger<350, pride<400, courage<500, neutrality<540, willingness<600, acceptance<650, reason<700, love>540, joy>600, peace>700, enlightenment>800.

- Identify predominant level per domain and overall.

## 4. Advice Generation

- For each domain: label current level, state benefit of adjacent next level, propose 2–3 focused actions.

- Format: “Current: Desire (310). To shift toward Courage (500): practice small daily challenges, affirm past successes, create accountability check.”

## 5. Hypnosis/Narrative Module

- Micro‑stories (200–300 words) framed as guided imagery: lead user from current level’s mindset to next.

- Insert embedded suggestions: “With each breath you feel a deeper sense of courage…”

- Option to choose audio playback with voice‑modulated pacing.

- Draft 10 micro‑stories covering transitions: Shame→Guilt, Desire→Anger, Anger→Courage, etc.

- Build UI flows for quiz→analysis→hypnosis sequence.

- Run small user study to validate emotional resonance and perceived usefulness.
