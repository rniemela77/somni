# Quiz Question Development Guidelines

## Neutral Framing

- Remove evaluative adjectives/adverbs that imply judgment (e.g., avoid “excellent,” “poor,” “rarely”).

- Replace with flat descriptors (e.g., “often,” “occasionally,” “sometimes”).

- Example: Change “How rarely do you fail at tasks?” to “I fail at tasks.”

## Indirect Scenarios

- Pose third-person or situational statements with minimal context cues.

- Ensure scenarios are unambiguous (e.g., specify setting: “At a team meeting…”).

- Imply behaviors without naming traits.

## Statement Polarity

- Use equal numbers of forward-keyed and reverse-keyed items (50/50 split).

- Identify reverse items by flipping statement valence (e.g., “I speak up often” vs. “I hold back my opinions”).

- Avoid wording that favors one end of the slider.

## Clarity and Brevity

- Keep each statement under 15 words; aim for 12 words when possible.

- Eliminate conjunctions and qualifiers.

Example transformation:

- Original: “When I am in a new group of people, I tend to remain silent until someone speaks to me.”

- Concise: “I remain silent until someone speaks to me.”

## Instinctive Triggers

- Use neutral action verbs and sensory cues (e.g., “I pause,” “I grab”).

- Avoid startling or stressful language; maintain comfortable tone.

- Frame statements as immediate, first-person reactions.

- Frame items as present-tense first-person statements: “I notice…,” “I avoid….”
