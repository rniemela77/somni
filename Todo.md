## Features

### Revamp quiz and AI analysis
Idea:
- identify a list of attributes to measure ones personality with. MBTI, David R Hawkins 'Levels of Consciousness', Big Five...
- each quiz will gauge one attribute (example attributes: introversion, extraversion, generosity, creativity...)
- each quiz question will +/- 0.1 to that attribute. No AI necessary.
- store that attribute on the user's profile
- show a radial graph or wheel
- use AI instead to make the full analysis based on all those points

### Setting quizzes
Idea:
- identify personality traits, challenges, or goals in different settings (home, career, friends...)
- isolate it to that area
- provide advice based on users personality to help target obstacles

### Formula for advice once profile is complete
Idea:
- "Utilize your [natural strength] to lean toward [user goal] and overcome [perceived weakness]"
- Leans on solid foundation of user's strengths and gives purpose to overcoming their weakness by focusing on the goal/target
